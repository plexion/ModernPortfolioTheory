## Applying Modern Portfolio Theory on a given set of stocks using the PyPortfolioOpt library
Modern Portfolio Theory, developed by American economist Harry Markowitz, introduces the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier is the curve segment connecting the minimum variance and maximum return portfolios. Any portfolios that don't lie on this efficient frontier will be inefficient, or in other words, they sacrefice return or risk unnecessarily.¹


There are many packages or libraries available to do the optimization required in Modern Portfolio Theory. I will be using [PyPorfolioOpt](https://pypi.org/project/pyportfolioopt/)², which I found to be very flexible.
